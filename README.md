In the dynamic world of project management, the ability to access, understand, and interact with project data is crucial. This is especially true for business stakeholders who need to stay informed about project progress, resource allocation, and potential bottlenecks. Traditionally, this information has been visualized through Kanban boards or was retrieved using complex queries build using specific querying languages. These mechanisms be challenging to navigate for non-technical stakeholders, or when dealing with complex projects with numerous work items.

This is where the power of plain text queries comes into play. By enabling plain text queries in natural language against your Project board in Azure DevOps, we can bridge the gap between technical project data and business understanding. This approach allows stakeholders to interact with the board using simple, natural language queries, bypassing the need for complex commands or technical jargon.

Imagine being able to ask your Kanban board, "Show me all tasks assigned to me that are in progress," or "Find all Open AI projects" and receiving an immediate and clear response. This level of interaction can dramatically improve the accessibility and usability of project data, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly.

While we eagerly await for the Azure DevOps team @ Microsoft to build this feature as a copilot, I made an attempt to achieve something similar by putting a few building blocks together.
